# PMD Release Notes

## ????? - 5.6.0-SNAPSHOT

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.6.0.

The most significant changes are on analysis performance and a whole new **Apex Security Rule Set**.

We have added initial support for **incremental analysis**. The experimental feature allows
PMD to cache analysis results between executions to speed up the analysis for all
languages. New CLI flags and Ant options are available to configure it. Currently
*the feature is disabled by default*, but this may change as it matures.

Multithread performance has been enhanced by reducing thread-contention on a
bunch of areas. This is still an area of work, as the speedup of running
multithreaded analysis is still relatively small (4 threads produce less
than a 50% speedup). Future releases will keep improving on this area.

Once again, *Symbol Table* has been an area of great performance improvements.
This time we were able to further improve it's performance by roughly 10% on all
supported languages. In *Java* in particular, several more improvements were possible,
improving *Symbol Table* performance by a whooping 30%, that's over 5X faster
than PMD 5.5.1, when we first started working on it.

Java developers will also appreciate the revamp of `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable`,
making it over 500X faster, and `PreserveStackTrace` which is now 7X faster.

### New and noteworthy

#### Incremental Analysis

PMD now support incremental analysis. Analysis results can be cached and reused between runs.
This allows PMD to skip files without violations that have remained unchanged. In future releases,
we plan to extend this behavior to unchanged files with violations too.

The cache is automatically invalidated if:
 * the used PMD version changes
 * the `auxclasspath` changed and any rules require type resolution
 * the configured rule set has changed

This feature is *incubating* and is disabled by default. It's only enabled if you
specifically configure a cache file.

To configure the cache file from CLI, a new `-cache <path/to/file>` flag has been added.

For Ant, a new `cacheLocation` attribute has been added. For instance:

```xml
    <target name="pmd">
        <taskdef name="pmd" classname="net.sourceforge.pmd.ant.PMDTask"/>
        <pmd cacheLocation="build/pmd/pmd.cache">
            <ruleset>rulesets/java/design.xml</ruleset>
            <ruleset>java-basic</ruleset>
            <formatter type="xml" toFile="c:\pmd_report.xml"/>
            <fileset dir="/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1_01/src/">
                <include name="java/lang/*.java"/>
            </fileset>
        </pmd>
    </target>
```

#### Apex Security Rule Set

A new ruleset focused on security has been added, consisting of a wide range of rules
to detect most common security problems.

##### ApexBadCrypto

The rule makes sure you are using randomly generated IVs and keys for `Crypto` calls.
Hard-wiring these values greatly compromises the security of encrypted data.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class without sharing Foo {
    Blob hardCodedIV = Blob.valueOf('Hardcoded IV 123');
    Blob hardCodedKey = Blob.valueOf('0000000000000000');
    Blob data = Blob.valueOf('Data to be encrypted');
    Blob encrypted = Crypto.encrypt('AES128', hardCodedKey, hardCodedIV, data);
}

```

##### ApexCRUDViolation

The rule validates you are checking for access permissions before a SOQL/SOSL/DML operation.
Since Apex runs in system mode not having proper permissions checks results in escalation of 
privilege and may produce runtime errors. This check forces you to handle such scenarios.

For example, the following code is considered valid:

```
public class Foo {
    public Contact foo(String status, String ID) {
        Contact c = [SELECT Status__c FROM Contact WHERE Id=:ID];

        // Make sure we can update the database before even trying
        if (!Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fields.Name.isUpdateable()) {
            return null;
        }

        c.Status__c = status;
        update c;
        return c;
    }
}
```

##### ApexCSRF

Check to avoid making DML operations in Apex class constructor/init method. This prevents
modification of the database just by accessing a page.

For instance, the following code would be invalid:

```
public class Foo {
    public init() {
        insert data;
    }

    public Foo() {
        insert data;
    }
}
```

##### ApexDangerousMethods

Checks against calling dangerous methods.

For the time being, it reports:

* Against `FinancialForce`'s `Configuration.disableTriggerCRUDSecurity()`. Disabling CRUD security
opens the door to several attacks and requires manual validation, which is unreliable.
* Calling `System.debug` passing sensitive data as parameter, which could lead to exposure
of private data.

##### ApexInsecureEndpoint

Checks against accessing endpoints under plain **http**. You should always use
**https** for security.

##### ApexOpenRedirect

Checks against redirects to user-controlled locations. This prevents attackers from
redirecting users to phishing sites.

For instance, the following code would be reported:

```
public class without sharing Foo {
    String unsafeLocation = ApexPage.getCurrentPage().getParameters.get('url_param');
    PageReference page() {
       return new PageReference(unsafeLocation);
    }
}
```

##### ApexSharingViolations

Detect classes declared without explicit sharing mode if DML methods are used. This
forces the developer to take access restrictions into account before modifying objects.

##### ApexSOQLInjection

Detects the usage of untrusted / unescaped variables in DML queries.

For instance, it would report on:

```
public class Foo {
    public void test1(String t1) {
        Database.query('SELECT Id FROM Account' + t1);
    }
}
```

##### ApexSuggestUsingNamedCred

Detects hardcoded credentials used in requests to an endpoint.

You should refrain from hardcoding credentials:
  * They are hard to mantain by being mixed in application code
  * Particularly hard to update them when used from different classes
  * Granting a developer access to the codebase means granting knowledge
     of credentials, keeping a two-level access is not possible.
  * Using different credentials for different environments is troublesome
     and error-prone.

Instead, you should use *Named Credentials* and a callout endpoint.

For more information, you can check [this](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_named_credentials.htm)

##### ApexXSSFromEscapeFalse

Reports on calls to `addError` with disabled escaping. The message passed to `addError`
will be displayed directly to the user in the UI, making it prime ground for XSS
attacks if unescaped.

##### ApexXSSFromURLParam

Makes sure that all values obtained from URL parameters are properly escaped / sanitized
to avoid XSS attacks.


#### New Rules

##### AccessorMethodGeneration (java-design)

When accessing a private field / method from another class, the Java compiler will generate a accessor methods
with package-private visibility. This adds overhead, and to the dex method count on Android. This situation can
be avoided by changing the visibility of the field / method from private to package-private.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class OuterClass {
    private int counter;
    /* package */ int id;

    public class InnerClass {
        InnerClass() {
            OuterClass.this.counter++; // wrong, accessor method will be generated
        }

        public int getOuterClassId() {
            return OuterClass.this.id; // id is package-private, no accessor method needed
        }
    }
}
```

This new rule is part of the `java-design` ruleset.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn` (ruleset java-design) no longer requires the variable declaration
    and return statement to be on consecutive lines. Any variable that is used solely in a return statement will be
    reported.

*   The Java rule `UseLocaleWithCaseConversions` (ruleset java-design) has been modified, to detect calls
    to `toLowerCase` and to `toUpperCase` also within method call chains. This leads to more detected cases
    and potentially new false positives.
    See also [bugfix #1556](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1556/).

*   The rule `AvoidConstantsInterface` (ruleset java-design) has been removed. It is completely replaced by
    the rule `ConstantsInInterface`.

*   The Java rule `UnusedModifier` (ruleset java-unusedcode) has been expanded to consider more redundant modifiers.
    *   Annotations marked as `abstract`.
    *   Nested annotations marked as `static`.
    *   Nested annotations within another interface or annotation marked as `public`.
    *   Classes, interfaces or annotations nested within an annotation marked as `public` or `static`.
    *   Nested enums marked as `static`.

#### CPD Suppression

It is now possible to allow CPD suppression through comments in **Java**. You tell CPD to ignore
the following code with a comment containin `CPD-OFF` and with `CPD-ON` you tell CPD to resume
analysis. The old approach via `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is still supported, but is considered
**deprecated**, since it is limited to locations where the `SuppressWarnings` annotation is allowed.
See [PR #250](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/250).

For example:

```java
    public Object someMethod(int x) throws Exception {
        // some unignored code

        // tell cpd to start ignoring code - CPD-OFF

        // mission critical code, manually loop unroll
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);

        // resume CPD analysis - CPD-ON

        // further code will *not* be ignored
    }
```

### API Changes

*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetFactory` is now immutable and its behavior cannot be changed anymore.
    It provides constructors to create new adjusted instances. This allows to avoid synchronization in RuleSetFactory.
    See [PR #131](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/131).
*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSet` is now immutable, too, and can only be created via `RuleSetFactory`.
    See [PR #145](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/145).
*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.XPathCLI` has been removed. It's functionality is fully covered by the Designer.
*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.Report` now works with `ThreadSafeReportListener`s. Both `ReportListener` and
    `SynchronizedReportListener` are deprecated in favor of `net.sourceforge.pmd.ThreadSafeReportListener`.
    Therefore, the methods `getSynchronizedListeners()` and `addSynchronizedListeners(...)` have been
    replaced by `getListeners()` and `addListeners(...)`. See [PR #193](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/193).
